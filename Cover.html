      <p>Sosa, for her part, stays home more, nervous about driving. When she does get on the road, she is hypervigilant, ready in case something goes wrong. She did take a flight with her daughter,
        but the girl turned bright red from anxiety on the descent.</p>
      <p>Despite their fears, her family will return to the river to mark the anniversary because of the other survivors, who have been a source of support, she said.</p>

      <p>As of 22 March 2022, 554 such flights have occurred, including terrorist or other attacks. Of these, 205 have involved at least 100 fatalities, 34 have had at least 200 fatalities, eight have had at least 300 fatalities, and four have had at least 500 fatalities.</p>
      <p>All those emergency landings incidents are proof that pilots and crew members are regularly capable of heroics with their braveness and professional attitude.</p>
